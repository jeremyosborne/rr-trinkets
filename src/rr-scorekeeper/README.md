## Scoring / counting

Simple React <-> Redux module geared towards keeping a tally of counts, maybe for a game, achievement system, or whatever your logical heart desires.

This module follows the spirit of [redux duck](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux), with some ++.

Please see the [stories](./stories.js) file for code-as-documentation. To see the code in action, run `npm start storybook`.
